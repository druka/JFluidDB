This is a direct port of FluidDB.net ( http://github.com/ntoll/FluidDB.NET/tree/master )
by Nicholas Tollervey ( http://ntoll.org/ ) from C# to Java.

See the AUTHORS file for contributors.

See the TODO file for the next things to be implemented.

Unit tests (using jUnit http://www.junit.org/) can be found in the tests directory under 
src/com/fluidinfo/

This is still a very early stage, but any help is appreciated in getting this up and running in a more 
complete fashion.

Currently we have a class (FluidConnector) that facilitates interaction with FluidDB, a suite of tests
for this class and some other helper classes.

This is the minimum required for interaction with FluidDB. In the coming days I (ntoll) will add higher
level abstractions in the form of helper classes to make the API a lot easier to use. These changes will
also be reflected in the .NET version of this library.

All feedback, patches, bug-reports are most welcome!
